# Multi-Aspect Signals NewGRF

### Features

* This GRF includes 4-aspect signal graphics (red, yellow, double-yellow, green) for the block signal, PBS and one-way PBS signal types.
* Two different styles of block signal graphics are included. Use the GRF parameter to select which to use.

### Requirements

* This GRF requires a non-standard version of OpenTTD which supports the signal graphics and multi-aspect features such as [JGR's patchpack](https://github.com/JGRennison/OpenTTD-patches) v0.43.0 or later.
* Realistic braking must be enabled for multi-aspect signalling to be enabled.

### Things not included

* This GRF does not include semaphores or any type of pre-signal.

### Development

* Compiling requires a forked verison of NML with additional features from [here](https://github.com/JGRennison/nml).
